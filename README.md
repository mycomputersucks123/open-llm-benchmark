Recently, there has been quite a buzz about the release of large language models by various companies. However, it seems like there's some confusion about what it means to be truly open source in the world of AI. Meta unveiled Llama2, claiming it to be open source, but here's the catch: they only released one part of it - the model weights. While this is a step in the right direction, it's not quite the full picture of what open source should entail, 'open enough' or 'open weights' does not necessarily mean its open source, and many people seems to be confused whether llama 2 is actually open source or not.

Unlike traditional software, there's no clear definition of what constitutes open source AI, leaving room for ambiguity. Allen institute for ai, or simply AI2 also released a large language model, it actually performs worse than llama but what makes it different from llama is that they made almost all parts of it open source. While we don't have a clear definition of open source AI yet, Ai2's approach could serve as a benchmark or reference point for the definition of open source ai for now (until there is a clear definition of open source ai). For examaple, If a new company launches a language model, we can compare it to Ai2's model to determine if it's truly open source or not. This could help prevent misinformation and ensure transparency in the AI community.

Of course releasing all parts of llms are hard because of legal issues and stuff, but the thing is that if companies or start-ups are not going to release it fully open, they should not state their models are open source (like meta themselves calling llama 2 open source), this just leads to confusion. Some may say that the model weights are the only thing thats needed for personal use since most people dont even have the resource to train a model, but who cares? Maybe in the future it could be trained with minimal resource, and its better than nothing anyways. Hoping Meta to release their next version of llama and other AI models fully open source, which means providing not just the model weights, but also the code, training data, and any other relevant components. By doing so, they can avoid confusion and contribute to the advancement of open source ai in a meaningful way.

while there isnt a clear defintion of open source ai, maybe this could be the closest?

All 5 checks are required to be open source, plus its not open source if you cant reproduce the language model from scratch
